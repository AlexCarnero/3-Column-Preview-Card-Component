## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS BEM
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned more about Flexbox and some ways to center or move elements. Also media queries, and discover the differences between max or min-width.

### Continued development

I'm planning to continue developing my responsive design skills, starting on mobile-first designs, because I was working on desktop first until now.


### Useful resources

-(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647380/max-width-vs-min-width) - This helped me to understand how max or min-width works.
